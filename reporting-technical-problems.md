# How to report technical problems

* Always write specifically what you are trying to accomplish, and what you are doing to accomplish it.
* Copy/paste a direct screenshot, command list or code fragment of the stuff you are doing.
* Copy/paste error output *directly*, or take a screenshot if that is not possible.
* Raise technical problems in the #technicalissues channel on the 42Brunel slack, raise them as "Issues" on GitHub only if you are 100% certain that it's a code issue.
