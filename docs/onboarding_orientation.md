## Introduction to Simulation Projects
Modeling and simulation involve creating physical and logical representations of real-world systems to produce data that aids in making predictions and informed decisions for NGOs or Governments. Our work takes a multidisciplinary approach, exploring ways to enhance and support modeling and simulation through research and collaborations with industry and other organisations.

### [FabSim3](https://fabsim3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
**What it is:**
FabSim3 is a Python-based automation toolkit that helps streamline the execution of computational workflows. It simplifies repetitive tasks and integrates various tools and simulations into a cohesive and automated process. The main paper describing it can be found [here](https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/25622/3/FullText.pdf)

**Why it is used:**
FabSim3 is used to enhance the efficiency and reproducibility of research workflows. It allows users to easily configure, deploy, and run simulations on local machines or high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, making it ideal for scientific research and engineering projects requiring complex computational tasks.

### [FLEE](https://flee.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
**What it is:**
FLEE is an agent-based simulation framework designed to model the movement of displaced populations during crises, such as conflicts or natural disasters. The main paper describing it can be found [here](https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/29347/1/FullText.pdf)

**Why it is used:**
FLEE is used to simulate how individuals or groups respond to crises, helping researchers and policymakers analyse population movements and make data-driven decisions. Its ability to integrate real-world data makes it a valuable tool for addressing humanitarian challenges and improving response strategies.

**How it works with FabSim3 and FabFlee:**
FLEE integrates seamlessly with FabSim3 through its plugin, FabFlee. FabSim3 automates the execution and management of FLEE simulations across various computational environments, such as local systems or high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. The FabFlee plugin enhances FLEE's functionality by simplifying data management, automating workflows, and enabling large-scale, reproducible simulations of displaced population dynamics. This combination allows researchers to focus on refining models and analyzing results without getting bogged down by manual execution tasks.

### [FACS](https://facs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
**What it is:**
FACS (Flu and Coronavirus Simulator) is an agent-based simulation framework designed to model the spread of infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19, in specific populations or geographic areas. Up to now, we have used it to model the spread of Covid-19 in various regions of Europe:

- The United Kingdom: Greater London, South-East and North-West of England

- Lithuania: The region of Klaipėda

- Romania: The city of Călărași

- Türkiye: The cities of Ankara and Istanbul

The main paper describing it can be found [here](https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/20914/4/FullText.pdf)

**Why it is used:**
FACS is used to analyse how infectious diseases spread within communities and evaluate strategies to mitigate outbreaks, such as social distancing, vaccination, and mask mandates. Its ability to model detailed population behaviors and interactions makes it an essential tool for public health planning and policymaking.

**How it works with FabSim3 and FabFACS:**
FACS can be integrated with FabSim3 through its plugin, FabFACS, to automate the execution of large-scale disease simulations.

## Getting Started with Project Documentation
* Thorough and clear project documentation is essential for collaboration and knowledge sharing.
* Follow these steps to contribute or review documentation effectively:
  1. **Read the Existing Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the structure and existing content.
  2. **Understand the Documentation Tools**:
     - Ensure you have Sphinx or other relevant tools installed.
     - Learn the basics of Markdown, as used in the project (this doc is also written in .md).
  3. **Contribute to the Documentation**:
     - Follow the existing style and structure.
     - Write concise and clear explanations.
     - Use proper headings, lists, and code blocks to maintain readability.
  4. **Test Your Changes**:
     - Build the documentation locally to ensure correctness.
     - Fix formatting or broken links as needed.

## Expectations for Students
* As a student, you are expected to:
  1. **Communicate Effectively**:
     - Attend all team meetings and actively participate.
     - Share progress regularly through updates or reports.
     - Ask questions when in doubt.

  2. **Collaborate and Learn**:
     - Work effectively with teammates on shared tasks.
     - Be open to feedback and use it to improve your work.
     - Take the initiative to learn new tools, concepts, or methods.

## Communication Tools
### 1. Slack
* **Why We Use Slack:**
  - Slack is the primary tool for team communication and collaboration.
  - It allows for real-time messaging, file sharing, and quick discussions across various channels.
  - NOTE: Messages on Slack disappear after 90 days so it should not be used for archiving purposes (e.g. storing papers or important debugging discussions).

* **Expectations for Using Slack:**
  - **Be Responsive**: Check messages regularly and try to respond within a day.
  - **Use Channels Effectively**:
    - Post messages in the appropriate channels (e.g., #general, #project-updates).
    - Use direct messages for private or sensitive discussions.
  - **Organize Communication**:
    - Use threads to keep conversations organized.
    - Use reactions or emojis to acknowledge messages when a reply isn’t needed.


### 2. Google Drive
* **Why We Use Google Drive:**
  - Google Drive is used for document sharing, version control, and collaborative editing.
  - It ensures that all team members have access to the latest versions of project documents and files.

* **Expectations for Using Google Drive:**
  - **Organize Files**: Save documents in the correct project folders with clear and descriptive filenames.
  - **Collaborate Effectively**:
    - Use comments and suggestions for feedback instead of directly editing shared files.
  - **Maintain Security**: Do not share Drive links outside the team without permission.
  - **Regular Updates**: Ensure any new versions of documents are uploaded promptly to keep the team aligned.
