Educational resources for students
===========================================================
This page is to support students and colleagues of Derek Groen (http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~csstddg) with reference material. It will contain selected material from http://www.github.com/djgroen/student-resources. 

Where to begin
---------------
- Go through the tutorials in the 'Essential Learning Resources' section to build your foundational knowledge. Some sections may be more suited for students than colleagues. 
- 'Legacy Tutorials' contains material that are no longer actively maintained or updated, it may be useful for anyone looking to deepen their knowledge in certain fields.
