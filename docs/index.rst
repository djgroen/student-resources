An automation toolkit for complex simulation tasks
===========================================================

FabSim3 is a Python-based automation toolkit for scientific simulation and data
processing workflows, licensed under the BSD 3-clause license. It is developed 
as part of VECMA (http://www.vecma.eu), and is part of the VECMA Toolkit 
(http://www.vecma-toolkit.eu).

FabSim3 is an automation toolkit for complex simulation tasks. FabSim3 helps
users to perform complex remote tasks from a local command-line, and to
automatically organise their data and environment variables when they
perform these tasks. FabSim3 supports the execution of single jobs, ensembles
of multiple jobs, and dynamic workflows through schedulers such as SLURM,
PBSPro, LoadLeveller and QCG. It stores
machine-specific configurations in the repository, and applies it to all
applications run on that machine. These configurations are updated by any
contributor who feels that a fix or improvement is required.

FabSim3 relies strongly on Fabric (http://www.fabfile.org, shown to work with
versions 1.5.3 and 1.10.0) and PyYAML. It has been used to run simulation
workflows on supercomputers such as ARCHER, SuperMUC, Carthesius, Eagle, as well
as local clusters and desktops.

FabSim3 is publicly available at: http://www.github.com/djgroen/FabSim3 The
accompanying software paper can be found here:

The public plugins for FabSim3 include:

* FabMD, focused on molecular dynamics.
* FabFlee, focused on agent-based modelling.
* FabUQCampaign, focused on UQ ensemble sampling.
* FabDummy, a dummy plugin used for testing the toolkit.
