    "## Types of agents\n",
    "When thinking about refugee movements, there are a few basic elements:\n",
    "- The refugees themselves.\n",
    "- The locations where the refugees reside\n",
    "- And possibly the paths (or routes) that interconnect the locations\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, this agent-based model features refugees that reside at a given location, and that move from one location to another as the time in the simulation progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network-based versus geographically pixelated\n",
    "\n",
    "In general there are two widespread basic approaches to ABM. One is network-based, where each location is an agent, and the location agents are interlinked using *path* agents. A second approach is geographically pixelated, where a region is subdivided into square areas, and the location of agents is indicated by the respective coordinates of the corresponding square areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The code\n",
    "What follows is a detailed investigation of the simulation code. The code works as is, but as part of this tutorial you're being asked to change some of its features from simplistic to something a bit more fancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imports\n",
    "In this tutorial we use very few dependencies, but the random library is an essential one, as agent-based simulations strongly rely on randomizers."
