# Good academic conduct

This file is meant to contain advice on ensuring that you lead your academic life in a respectful, considerate and reasonable manner.

* It's always important in academia and work not to move deadlines forward if there are not very strong reasons for it. Doing so induces a lot of work-related tension on your peers, which is usually not favourably received.
* When replying e-mails, don't limit yourself to just answering the queries provided. Instead, write your reply with a focus on getting the larger task completed successfully. E.g., when agreeing to a time slot for meeting up, provide a wide range of availabilities, and allow the other person to pick one and put it in his/her calendar straight away.
