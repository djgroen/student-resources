## Inspiration/template idea on how to divide your FYP dissertation content (assuming 10k word count total)

* introduction: ~1500
  * describe problem  
  * describe why it's important
  * describe how you plan to solve it (aims & objectives)
* background: ~3000
  * describe related research + essential details for understanding your work
* approach: ~2000
* results: ~2000
* conclusion / discussion: ~1500
* appendices: any length (does not count towards word limit)
* references: Typically 20-100, and be sure not to list *only* website references.

### Writing an introduction

A good start is to first write your *aim* (1 sentence) and your objectives (typically 4-6 bullet points). Both aims and objectives need to be focused, and realistically achievable in the time frame of the project (typically 3 person months for FYPs).

Typical objectives can include:
* Some element of analyzing/reviewing existing literature.
* Some element of designing/developing some kind of method that will serve to achieve your aim.
* Applying your method to a number of test/validation situations.
* Evaluating whether your method has been successful at achieving your aim, and how it can be improved in future projects.

When describing the problem, stick only to the themes that you _directly_ mention in your aim and objectives. Other, more tangential information should be either in the background (if it's of likely interest to the reader) or left out (if it is not).

When describing importance, focus specifically on who achieving you *aim* is important. What are the broader implications if your project is successful?
