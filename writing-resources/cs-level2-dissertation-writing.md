# General tips for Dissertation Writing for Level 2

## Quantifying contributions
* Make a table, containing in each column: 1-line summary of the contribution, type of contribution (design, frontend or backend), with whom you made the contribution, reference to the subsection in your portfolio that describes the contributions.

## Writing the individual contributions
Describe:
* What you exactly contributed.
* Why did you things the way you did it? What are alternative ways of doing it, compare the pros/cons of your approach with the alternatives.
* Motivate your considerations and design/implementations decisions using literature sources. (e.g., technical documents, scientific papers or reflective web articles).

## Writing 
* Write clearly and concisely. Avoid using many complicated words and overly long sentences, particularly if you are aware that your English skills are limited.
* Have every part of your dissertation proofread, ideally by different people.

## Presenting designs 
* Make diagrams easy to read and consistent.
* Justify _every_ design choice you make, ideally by annotating your picture. Base as many of your justifications as you can on relevant literature sources.
* Discuss the merits and drawbacks of alternative designs.

## Self reflections
* Avoid value judgements, such as "I did an outstanding job". Instead, provide specific examples of contributions and mention the observations upon which you base your self reflections.
* Always mention what you would different if you would do the same task again, and why.

## Learning outcomes
* Add body to your motivations by referring to relevant sections for details, but do not omit the main justification for meeting the Learning Outcomes in the Table itself.
