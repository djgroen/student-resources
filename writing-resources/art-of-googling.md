# Tips on how to use Google efficiently for finding solutions

## Programming issues

When you don't know how to program a certain thing, try putting the following phrase in Google:

<programming language> <keywords of what you are trying to do> <keyword(s) of the objects/functions you are using>

e.g., if you want to find out how you sort a list in Python, you should try something along the lines of.

"python sort list"
